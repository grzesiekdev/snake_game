# Snake game

Simple snake game written in Python 3.8 for Linux Terminal. My maing goal was to keep it away from big libraries like curses, pygame, or even tkinter. I've tried to make it working in terminal, and i think that i've achieved that. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See 'Run live version' for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

```
cd tests
sudo python test_main.py
```

## Run live version

After you've cloned the repo, you can simply run: 
```
sudo python main.py
```
Unfortunetly, on Linux you need to run app with root privileges, because keyboard lib needs it.
