# Snake game

Simple snake game written in Python 3.8 for Linux Terminal

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

More tests will be made, but you can run current ones by: 
```
cd tests
sudo python test_main.py
```

## Run live version

After you've cloned the repo, you can simply run: 
```
sudo python main.py
```
Unfortunetly, on Linux you need to run program with root privileges, because keyboard lib needs it.
